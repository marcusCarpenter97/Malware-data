# Behavioural reports on Multi-stage malware #

This repository contains the code for the research paper entiteled above which
is currently under peer review by the IEEE Transactions on Sustainable
Computing.

A preprint can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12800).

The dataset itself is hosted on [not available yet](https://github.com/marcusCarpenter97/Malware-data)

To run the experiments simply call the following command:
`
python3 experiments.py
`

For the results to be properly saved you will need to create a `results`
directory in the same folder the experiments module is run,
or edit the `SAVE_DIR` path.

NOTE: experiments can only be rerun with the published dataset or an
equivalent.
