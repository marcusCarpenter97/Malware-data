This repository contains the code for the research paper entiteled above.

Carpenter, Marcus; Luo, Chunbo (2023) Behavioural Reports of Multi-Stage Malware. [arXiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12800)

The dataset itself is hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marcuscarpenter97/api-calls-generated-by-dynamic-malware-analysis)

To run the experiments simply call the following command:
`
python3 experiments.py
`

For the results to be properly saved you will need to create a `results`
directory in the same folder the experiments module is run,
or edit the `SAVE_DIR` path.

NOTE: experiments can only be rerun with the published dataset or an
equivalent.
